Each team will focus on two design patterns and their application to a scientific computing problem.

== Team 1: Singleton and Factory Method Patterns

=== Design Patterns Overview
Singleton Pattern:: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
Factory Method Pattern:: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

=== Application in Scientific Computing
Problem:: Managing a global configuration for a simulation environment where multiple components need access to shared settings.
Solution::
+
- Implement a Singleton class to handle the global configuration, ensuring all components access the same instance.
- Use the Factory Method pattern to create various simulation objects (e.g., solvers, models) based on configuration parameters, allowing for flexibility and scalability.

== Team 2: Observer and Strategy Patterns

=== Design Patterns Overview
Observer Pattern:: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
Strategy Pattern:: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

=== Application in Scientific Computing
Problem:: Developing a data analysis framework where multiple analysis modules need to respond to changes in data, and different algorithms can be applied to the data processing pipeline.
Solution::
+
- Use the Observer pattern to notify analysis modules of data changes, ensuring synchronization across modules.
- Apply the Strategy pattern to allow dynamic selection of data processing algorithms, enabling the framework to adapt to various analysis requirements.

== Team 3: Adapter and Composite Patterns

=== Design Patterns Overview
Adapter Pattern:: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge between two interfaces.
Composite Pattern:: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

=== Application in Scientific Computing

Problem:: Integrating legacy numerical libraries with new systems and representing complex mathematical expressions or computational processes hierarchically.
Solution::
  - Utilize the Adapter pattern to create interfaces that allow legacy code to interact seamlessly with new components.
  - Implement the Composite pattern to model complex expressions or processes, enabling uniform treatment of both simple and composite entities within simulations or calculations.

== General Instructions

Each team must:

- Present the theoretical aspects of their assigned design patterns.
- Provide C++ implementation examples.
- Demonstrate their application to the specified scientific computing problem.

=== Objectives

This project aims to provide students with a deep understanding of design patterns and their importance in software engineering, particularly in the context of scientific computing and machine learning. 
By analyzing, implementing, and applying design patterns to real-world problems, students will learn how to write more maintainable, scalable, and reusable code. 
The collaborative nature of the project encourages teamwork and communication, while the focus on C++ helps students gain hands-on experience with a language widely used in high-performance computing and scientific research. 
Through this project, students will not only enhance their problem-solving skills but also bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications, preparing them for complex software development challenges in their academic and professional careers.

=== Evaluation Criteria

The evaluation of students will be based on how well they achieve the project objectives, demonstrating both technical and collaborative skills.
